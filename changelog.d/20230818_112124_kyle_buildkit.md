- [Deprecation] The template variable ``is_buildkit_enabled``, which now always returns True, is deprecated. Plugin authors should assume BuildKit is enabled and remove the variable from their templates (by @kdmccormick).
- ðŸ’¥[Deprecation] Tutor no longer supports the legacy Docker builder, which was previously available by setting ``DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0`` in the host environment. Going forward, Tutor will always use BuildKit (a.k.a. ``docker buildx`` in Docker v19-v22, or just ``docker build`` in Docker v23). This transition will improve build performance and should be seamless for Tutor users who are running a supported Docker version (by @kdmccormick).
